# Lab Material for Chisel in Digital Electronics 2

This repository provides lab material for the
[Digital Electronics course (02139)](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02139/) at DTU.
Although this lab is customized for the DTU course, it can also serve as
introduction lab for digital design with [Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/).

The lab is based on:
[Digital Design with Chisel](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/chisel-book.html), by Martin Schoeberl.

To use this material you can:
(1) download the repo as a .zip file,
(2) clone the repo to have all material offline (using it also for your solutions),
(3) fork the repo (and clone locally), to be able to contribute back with changes,
or (4) simply just browse it online on GitHub.

Best is to have all the tools installed on your laptop,
see also: [Setup.md](Setup.md)

We collect frequently asked questions in the [FAQ.md](FAQ.md).

**Contributions:** We are happily accepting contributions in the form of
pull requests. Even the fix of a small typo is appreciated.
